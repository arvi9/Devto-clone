# Development Todos

_NEEDS FIX_

- Post publishedDate

- useGetPostsQuery made an async thunk because neither useQuery nor useLazyQuery is working

- Logging out makes this error => `Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.`

_NEEDS FINISHING_
