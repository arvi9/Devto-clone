_NEEDS FIX_

Socket.io Realtime Notifications (do without setTimeout), resize onMobile, limit cuz it renders a lot, likeComment, replyComment

Optimistic updates (Bookmarking post homepage, follow tags page not tag page)

.ENV variables

Made a socket context instead of slice (STANDBY)

OnEdit dashboard displays EditPost page before loading post (STANDBY)

Flash on Saving a post (in PostsList)

Reply deletion results in deleting the lowest reply until refresh

Detection of what inputs changed on post edit (do not reupload the same image!)
