# Development Todos

_NEEDS FINISHING_

Add new Notification types: likeComment and replyComment

Redirect to previous page he was on if refresh token expired and he was redirected to login and actually logged back

_NEEDS FIX_

On Production disable redux/react -devtools

Deletion of a reply (only) results in deleting the lowest one on that specific comment until refetch/refresh

Detection of what inputs changed on post edit (do not reupload the same image!)

Flash on Saving a post (in PostsList)

Refetching on receiving a notification from socket.io with a 1 sec delay setTimeout do without (STANDBY)

Made a socket context instead of redux slice (STANDBY)

OnEdit dashboard displays EditPost page before loading post (STANDBY)
